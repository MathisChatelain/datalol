# League of Legends Data Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze and visualize data related to League of Legends. It includes raw data, processed data, and various scripts for data processing, analysis, and visualization.

## Context

This is my first data analysis project as a beginner data analyst transitioning from a web development background. 

I have been playing League of Legends for over 10 years and have invested countless hours into the game. While rank is often a contentious topic in the community, I typically peak around mid-Diamond when I have the time and motivation to play seriously. 

Please note that English is not my native language, so I apologize in advance for any grammatical errors or limited vocabulary.
