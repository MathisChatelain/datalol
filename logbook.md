# Logbook

This is the raw logbook of the project, where I will document my daily progress, challenges, and thoughts. My goal is to better retain the lessons learned from this project by reflecting on my experiences as I work through it.


## Day one ( 10/04/2025 )

    - Started the project by creating a skeleton for what I suppose I am going to need.
    - I wrote the first version of the "scope" notebook. Initially, I didnâ€™t plan on using notebooks, but after trying them, I found them to be an excellent way to document and communicate the project effectively. Additionally, gaining experience with notebooks will be a valuable skill to highlight on my resume.
    - I started gettting into the riot game api while writting the "data_collection" notebook.
    - I had to setup jupyter's kernel correctly in order to make inline code work.
    - I started collecting data, more precisely I am currently fetching the player ids of every ranked active player from diamond 1 to bronze 4.
    - I did some tinkering and many different changes to the ranked player collection script, my goal for the day is now to make a first vizualisation of the player repartition by rank, I am currently looking at vizualisation libraries in Python.
